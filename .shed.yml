long_description: |
        L1 Chimeric Transcripts (LCTs)  are transcribed from LINE 1 antisense promoter and include the L1 5â€™UTR sequence in antisense orientation followed by the adjacent genomic region. CLIFinder is a Galaxy tool, specifically designed to identify  potential LCTs from one or several oriented RNA-seq paired-end reads in the human genome. CLIFinder is customizable to detect transcripts initiated by different types of repeat elements.
